# TelegramWeatherBotJava

This is a bot created for telegram. I used the API of some sites to implement this project.
The main functions of the bot: 
1. The bot can show the weather in the city that you write to it
2. The bot can display the number of COVID-19 cases in a certain country.
3. When sending your location to the bot, it will send you the information. Temperature, Number of cases of COVID-19, national currency
4. The bot can create a quiz based on data on the number of COVID-19 cases in any country. The bot can also create a quiz with a random country.
